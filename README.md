## 📘 About

This repository contains my **solutions and implementations** for **Harvard’s CS50x 2025: Introduction to Computer Science**.  
It includes all **labs** and **problem sets (PSets)** completed throughout the course, each achieving **100% correctness** upon submission.

You can explore:
- 🔹 My personal solutions   
- 🔹 CS50’s official instructions (provided for each Lab/PSet)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

A quick word on **Academic Honesty** —  

While these solutions can help you navigate the course, I strongly encourage you to **try solving each problem yourself first**.  
Spending the time and effort to find your own solution is the best way to truly understand and master the concepts.  

That said, feel free to peek at my code and learn from my approach — and remember to **have fun!**
