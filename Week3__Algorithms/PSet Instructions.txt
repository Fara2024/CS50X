What to Do
Submit Sort
Submit Plurality
Submit one of:
Runoff, if feeling more or less comfortable
Tideman, if feeling very, very, very comfortable
If you submit both Runoff and Tideman, we’ll record the higher of your two scores. Note that Tideman is optional but challenging!

Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 3’s source code.
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile plurality, and
make plurality
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make plurality
instead!
