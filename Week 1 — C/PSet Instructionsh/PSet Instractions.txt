Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 1’s source code.
See CS50’s style guide for C for tips on how to improve your code’s style.
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile hello, and
make hello
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make hello
instead!
