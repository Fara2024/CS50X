# Week 0 — Scratch Project 🎮

## 📘 About
This is my **Scratch project** for **Harvard’s CS50x – Week 0: Introduction to Computer Science**.  
The goal of this assignment was to create an interactive and creative project using **Scratch**, demonstrating basic programming concepts such as:
- Events and loops  
- Variables and conditions  
- Sprites and movement  
- Sound and interaction
