Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from Week 5.
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile speller, and

make speller
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make speller
instead!
