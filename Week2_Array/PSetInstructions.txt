Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 2’s examples.
To see the manual pages for C functions, visit manual.cs50.io.
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile readability, and
make readability
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make readability
instead!
